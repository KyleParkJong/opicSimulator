 OPIc is an Internet-based (iBT) candidate-friendly foreign language speaking evaluation that makes it as close as possible to OPI, a 1:1 interview evaluation, and is not just a test to measure how much grammar and vocabulary you know, but an objective language evaluation tool to measure how effectively and appropriately you can use language in real life.
